# Coding-Sample: NeurIPS 2023
The repo is my coding sample of the paper published at NeurIPS 2023, and it is used for my PhD application.

1. The dataloading.py is a sample of loading the Alzheimer's Disease dataset, and the model fine-tuning.py is used to fine-tune the model. 
2. The TFC baseline folder contains some key Python files including the model, loss, and main trainer.
